      - name: light-Bot 2
        desc: |
          Program the robot and light up the fields. This is a much enhanced
          sequel (to the [original](http://armorgames.com/play/2205/light-bot))
          that now supports _conditional statements_, full _recursion_, and doesn't
          suffer the clumsy controls like the first version...
          
          If you only play one game here, play this one!
          Made by Coolio Niato — Great stuff, man! `;)`
      - name: Jahooma's LogicBox
        height: 600
        desc: |
          Jahooma's LogicBox is a game for programmers. It effectively
          teaches the essence of **functional** and **modular design
          of algorithms and procedures**, with an added aspect of test-driven development
          (you are given several tests that must all pass).

          The problems are highly practical — low level string manipulation.
          With only 19 levels, the game runs a little short, but there
          is no shortage of educational fun to be had! Don't skip this one.

        desc: >
          RoboZZle, with its user-submitted puzzles, must be one of the hardest
          puzzle games ever. Unfortunately, the rich interface is locked into
          Silverlight.
      - name: Frame Protector SYNC
        desc: |
          F.P.S. is a programming game similar to [light-Bot](#programming/light-bot-2),
          but with **more options**, more contrasting colors, **more levels**,
          and more **relevant** (programming) **terminology**.

          Dive in the world of Hackers and help SYNC fix the hipster vandalism
          of The Dead Pixel Society.

    games:
      - name: Codex of Alchemical Engineering
        desc: |
          Truly a game for engineers. Your goal is to **build machines out of
          programmable mechanical arms** that move and transform basic elements
          to create compounds as required to pass each level.

          The game is a little short on introduction, but when everything "clicks,"
          The Codex of Alchemical Engineering might just become one of the most
          captivating logic puzzle experiences you've encountered in years.

          When you complete it, there is a (warning: very challenging)
          [sequel](#programming/codex-2-magnum-opus-challenge) available.
      - name: "Codex 2: Magnum Opus Challenge"
        desc: |
          This is a sequel to the original [Codex of Alchemical Engineering](#programming/codex-of-alchemical-enginering).
          It features original puzzles made by the author and game fans, but beware,
          these puzzles are extremely challenging; each one will likely take
          you hours to complete, depending on how smart you are.

          If you like these kinds of games, you may want to go to your
          local university and get an engineering or computer science degree. `;)`

  <h3 id="about">About this site</h3>
  <p>I was gathering up useful resources for <a href="http://www.coderdojo.si">Slovenian</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoderDojo">CoderDojo</a> course,
  and I stumbled upon <a href="#programming/light-bot-2">light-Bot 2</a> and <a href="http://www.robozzle.com">RoboZZle</a> at
  <b>HappyNerds' wonderful collection of <a href="http://happynerds.net/view/browser">programming resources for kids</a></b>.</p>
  <p>One game led to the other, and — after a few days of ecstatic playing — I figured I would make the job easier for
  others pursuing the same task – searching for <b>games with real educational value</b>
  that help one <b>develop not only the interactive problem-solving skills</b>,
  but also create very real <b>hands-on experience</b> or depth of <b>understanding
  of a particular real-world field</b>. And for watchful parents and their likes.
  Gathered are, incidently, some of the <b>best puzzle games ever created</b>.</p>
  <p style="font-weight:bold;color:grey;">With that regard, I have a <b>challenge for you</b>. Go search for other
  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=educational+games">"educational games"</a>
  online and compare your findings with the games listed here. You might find
  the state of affairs is quite sad, really.</p>
  <p>Find the games in the menu above. Most games require Adobe Flash, some are
  links to their respective websites. <noscript>The page requires JavaScript enabled.</noscript></p>
  <p>If you <b>have a suggestion</b> for an educative game or a new category, <b>drop me a line</b> on <u style="white-space:nowrap;">kernc<i></i>ece+edu<i></i>games<i></i>/on\<i></i>gmail</u>,
  or better yet, if you wish, just add the new game yourself via a "pull request" on <a href="http://github.com/kernc/educative-games.tk">GitHub</a>. :)
