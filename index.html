      - name: light-Bot 2
        desc: |
          **Program the robot** and light up the fields. This is a much enhanced
          sequel that now supports _conditional statements_, and it doesn't
          suffer the clumsy controls like the [original](http://armorgames.com/play/2205/light-bot) version...
          
          If you only play one **programming game** here, play this one! `;)`
      - name: Jahooma's LogicBox
        height: 600
        desc: |
          Jahooma's LogicBox is a game for programmers. It effectively
          teaches the essence of **functional** and **modular design
          of algorithms and procedures**, with an added aspect of test-driven development
          (you are given several tests that must all pass).
          
          The problems are highly practical — low level string manipulation.
          With only 19 levels, the game runs a little short, but there
          is no shortage of educational fun to be had! Don't skip this one.

        href: "http://robozzle.com/js/"
        desc: |
          RoboZZle, with its user-submitted puzzles, must be one of the hardest
          puzzle games ever. Unfortunately, the rich interface is locked into
          Silverlight.
      - name: Frame Protector SYNC
        desc: |
          F.P.S. is a programming game **similar to [light-Bot](#programming/light-bot-2)**,
          but with **more options**, more contrasting colors, **more levels**,
          and more relevant (programming) **terminology**.
          
          Dive in the world of Hackers and help SYNC fix the hipster vandalism
          of The Dead Pixel Society.
      - name: Vim Snake

        desc: |
          Everybody knows how to play snake.
          But snake responding to Vim cursor keys is a whole 'nother story.
          Vim is one of the advanced text-editors the best programmers use.

        href: "https://www.bloc.io/ruby-warrior"
        desc: |
          While everybody would much prefer it were the language of choice Python,
          Ruby is an increasingly-relevant programming language not only
          for web development.
          
          This is **a bit more advanced** perhaps than the other programming
          games. **Real computer programming ahead**.
      - name: Programming Basics
        href: "http://www.programmingbasics.org/"
        desc: |

      - name: Codex of Alchemical Engineering
        height: 550
        desc: |
          Truly a game for engineers. Your goal is to **build machines out of
          programmable mechanical arms** that move and transform basic elements
          to create compounds as required to pass each level.
          
          The game is a little short on introduction, but when everything "clicks,"
          The Codex of Alchemical Engineering might just become one of the most
          captivating logic puzzle experiences you've encountered in years.
          
          When you complete it, there is a (warning: **very challenging**)
          [**sequel**](#programming/codex-2-magnum-opus-challenge) available.
      - name: Geared Up Cogs
        desc: |
          Not your typical, trivial cogs game. Using gears, gear trains, ratios,
          and other simple components, you are geared up for ...
          **building a real wall clock mechanism**.
      - name: "Codex 2: Magnum Opus Challenge"
        height: 550
        desc: |
          This is a sequel to the original
          [**Codex of Alchemical Engineering**](#programming/codex-of-alchemical-enginering).
          It features original puzzles made by the author and game fans, but **beware**,
          these **puzzles are extremely challenging**; each one might take
          you hours to complete, depending on how attentive you are.
          
          If you like these kinds of games, you may want to go to your
          local university and get an engineering or computer science degree. `;)`
      - name: Manufactoria
        desc: |
          You are to **design conveyor belts** for Quality Assurance department
          of a robot manufacturer. The robots, pre-programmed with a series of
          colored dots, sometimes include invalid programs (invalid **patterns**).
          Your job is to send the quality-control-passing robots for wrapping,
          and the rest on the factory floor.
      - name: Fantastic Contraption 2
        desc: |
          Given basic **functional building blocks**, construct a contraption
          that reaches its goal.
      - name: Electric Box 2
        desc: |
          Get electricity from point A to point B,
          using every sort of tool imaginable.
          Kind of like the electrical-only counterpart of The Incredible Machine.
          No disrespect to The Incredible Machine series.

          The reviewer is shy to admit she doesn't really understand any of this game.
          Sorry. Please add to this description as convenient.
      - name: Roller-Coaster Designer
        height: 600
        desc: |
          Design the technical specifications, namely the elevation at each
          step, for a working **roller-coaster** in supposedly physically-correct simulation.
      - name: Cyrcuit
        desc: |
          The **electric circuit construction** game.
          The goal of this electricity game is to connect up all of the
          power sources for a full flowing circuit sharing continuous, perpetual energy.
          
          There's at least one **effective algorithm** to solve these challenges fairly quickly.
          Can you find it?
      - name: Clockwork
        desc: |
          Not too dificult puzzle game where you have to free an item from
          a set of **interlocking pieces** that all move at the same time
          and in unsynchronized speeds, much like in a clock.
          
          It's a pretty easy game, though. Definitely use the keyboard shortcuts.
  - name: touch-typing
    desc: Become in unity with your keyboard, reach 110 WPM.
    games:
      - name: "MoonType: Episode 2"
        height: 600
        desc: |
          Defend the Moon from evil destroyers by spelling out on your keyboard

      - name: Evolution in Action
        desc: |
          Darwin recognized that **species evolve over time as their environment changes**.
          In this interactive visualization, see for yourself how a
          changing environment (represented by changing background color) can
          impact the evolution of a population of virtual creatures.
          Like real-world organisms, these creatures are born, produce offspring — some of which randomly mutates — and die off.
          How will they evolve?
      - name: Sunny Meadows
        desc: |
          In every ecosystem there is a **food chain**. In the food chain,
          species can be _consumers_ (who eat other species),
          or _producers_ (who are eaten by other species), or both.
          The populations can depend on each other. Find out how in this game of
          **rabbits, foxes, and weeds**.
          What happens during and after the simulated 50 years?
          
          How does this translate to the real-world economy and social class,
          and what does it mean for it?

          Simulate the **genetic pea experiments** of Gregor Mendel with this
          game. It won't take you years to figure and test it out.
          
          If terms like _allele_, _homozygote_, _heterozygote_, _dominant_ and _recessive_ traits,
          [mean anything to you](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance#Mendel.27s_laws),
          or even if they don't (yet) but you **fancy some elementary biology**,
          this game is for you!
          Field-introductory **simple-English instructions provided**.
      - name: Plant Force

        desc: |
          A game similar to chess, with some moves similar to
          [Chinese chess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi).
          Practicing with this fun toy may improve one's game in both.
      - name: "Black Knight: Insurrection"
        height: 530
        desc: |
          Move like a chess Knight, kill the pawns, kill the King, open locks,
          collect the star. A fun, **chess-related** game.

      - name: The Drake Equation
        desc: |
          Does **extra-terrestrial intelligent life**, capable of communicating with us, exist?
          The question is easier to address when framed as a numbers game.
          It's called the [Drake Equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation).
          Learn about the **probability** of another civilization in our galaxy by playing with the numbers yourself.
      - name: Interlocked
        desc: |
          Take apart these twenty **3D interlocking mechanical block puzzles**.
          It will kill time all the while ever so slightly increasing your
          spatial awareness.
          
          The game does an amazing job at recreating an engaging, playable
          version of real-world mechanical puzzle blocks, and that's sure
          to work **the visual-spatial part of your brain** into shape!
      - name: Out of Balance
        desc: |
          A logic primer. Each level asks you to **pick the heaviest object**
          based on the **relative weights indicated by the slant** of each seesaw.
          While the game is not that _rewarding_ end-wise, some of the later
          6-seesaw puzzles may have even the adults scratching their heads.
          
          The only major problem I see is that round objects tend to move
          and not stay still when on a slope.

        height: 600
        desc: |
          The elders know **Windows is a sinister operating system**.
          This is a (not so funny) **parody of Microsoft Windows**, their
          cumbersome, under-performant, erronous ways, and the associated back doors.
          See [why **GNU/Linux is better**](http://whylinuxisbetter.net/).
